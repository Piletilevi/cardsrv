### Special note

Please make sure, that connected wires are connected in same order over all installations.
Also make sure port mapping is identical everywhere.  

Even better - create a document, where required wiring and port mapping is described and every time someone drives to point of sale to install the printers, give these instructions along.  

Thank me later.
